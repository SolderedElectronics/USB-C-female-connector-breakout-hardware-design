The USB Type-C is ubiquitous. We always wanted to add it to our electronics projects, and we’re sure you did too. Adding a USB Type-C connector to your projects is easier than ever thanks to this USB Type-C breakout board. It will allow you to send data to your device, as well as add power to the circuit.




The USB Type-C connector’s GND, CC2, SBU2, D-, D+, SBU1, CC1, and VUSB pins are broken out to the plated through-holes.
